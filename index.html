				<h2>The Story</h2>
				<p>
					The story takes place in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, and features a large cast of main characters, 
					including a modern-day Dullahan, an anonymous internet-based gang called the Dollars, 
					color gangs like the Yellow Scarves and Blue Squares, a demon sword known as Saika, information brokers, 
					debt collectors, movie stars, high school students, yakuza, and many other colorful characters. 
					As the Dullahan searches for her missing head, different sides converge and conflict escalates. 
					The story follows the main characters equally as they affect and are affected by the events in the city around them.
